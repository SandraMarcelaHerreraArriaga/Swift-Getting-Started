 ## Challenge - Logical operators
 You've been provided with a  constant named myAge below that's already been assigned a value. Feel free to change the value of this constant to match your actual age
 Use that constant to create an if-else statement to print out "Teenager" if the value of myAge greater or than 13 but less than or equal to 19, and to print out "Not a teenager" if the value is outside that range

 then print out the value of teenagerName
