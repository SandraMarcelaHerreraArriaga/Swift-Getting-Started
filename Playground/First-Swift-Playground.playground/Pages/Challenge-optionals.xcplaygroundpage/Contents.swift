 # Challenge - optionals
 
 ## Challenge 1
 You've been provided with a constat below, hasAllergies, which gas been set to true.
 Below that, declare a Optional string variable named dogName.
 On the next line use a ternary conditional operator to set the value of dogName to nil if hasAllergies is true and to "Mongo" otherwise.

/*:

## Challenge 2
Create a constant called parsedInt and set it to Int("10"). Swift will attempt to parse the string 1- and convert it to an Int.
 Place your mouse over the constant name and use Option-Click to check the type of parsedInt. Why is parsedInt an optional here?
